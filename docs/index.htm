    <h2>First Bus celebrate an increase in passenger numbers</h2>

    <p>
    First Bus (who operate Buses of Somerset) have said an extra 6 millions journeys were made in the West of England during 2023,
    compared to the previous year.
    </p>

    <p>
    Much of this can be attributed to the bus fare cap that is currently in place, which limits many local bus trips to Â£2 for a single journey.

    <h2>First Buses of Somerset pull out of Taunton Park and Ride Contract.</h2>

    <p>
    First Buses of Somerset have informed Somerset Council that they intend to pull out of the local contract to operate the Taunton
    Park and Ride service, which runs buses back and forth between the Silk Mills and Gateway car parks.
    </p>

    <p>The company claim operating the service is no longer viable for them from a business perspective.</p>

    <p>
    First Buses of Somerset have operated the Taunton Park & Ride since 2014, when they became the interim contractor after WebberBus lost
    the contract due to complaints about the service. First Buses of Somerset later became the permanent operator of the service.
    </p>

    <p>
    Somerset Council put the contract out to tender, and awarded the contract to Stagecoach South West, who it's believed
    will operate the service with buses based at their Tiverton depot.
